# Encode Time Calculator
Here is a simple encode time calculator!

To use it, in the "Time in input" fields, type the time stamp of the video (length in hours, minutes and seconds). These values can be nonstandard, such as 85 minutes, 67 seconds, etc. The code thoroughly converts all the data to minutes to be processed.

Once the "Time in input" fields are filled in, fill in the "Time elapsed encoding" fields. The meaning of this is the progress (timestamp) the video has encoded through. Say "57 minutes encoded of 60 minutes".

Now, fill in the "Speed multiplier" value. This is the speed the video is encoding at, say 3x. Do not include "x" at the end of the value. It is already interpreted as a multiplier by the script.

Hit enter, or click "Calculate" and see how long the video encode will take to complete!
